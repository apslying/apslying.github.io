Hi! I'm Hengyi Wu. This site showcases my research, publications, and academic activities.

About Me
======
I'm currently pursuing a MS in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park (2024-2026), with a focus on machine learning. My research interests include **Continual Learning and Memory Systems for Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Prior to my MS, I worked as a Software Engineer. I hold a BA in Mathematics and Computer Science from NYU.

<!-- Research Interests
======
- **Large Language Models**: Investigating Tool-Assisted Agentic AI and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- **Machine Learning Theory**: Probabilistic PCA for Matrix Factorization and Collaborative Filtering
- **Efficient Deep Learning**: Memory-efficient architectures and optimization techniques

Current Projects
======
- **Efficient LLM**: Incorporating memory efficient LoRa layers to Transformer and feed forward layers
- **Deep Averaging Network**: Built a deep learning averaging network achieving over 92% accuracy on QA tasks
- **Tool-Assisted AI**: Testing LLaMA 3 and GPT-4's Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities on GSM8K dataset -->
