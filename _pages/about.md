Hi! I'm Hengyi Wu. This site showcases my research, publications, and academic activities.

About Me
======
I'm currently pursuing a MS in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park (2024-2026), with a focus on machine learning. My research interests include **Continual Learning and Memory Systems for Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Prior to my MS, I worked as a Software Engineer. I hold a BA in Mathematics and Computer Science from NYU.

<!-- Research Interests
